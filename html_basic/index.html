         <p> This is my first HTML Webpage. I am taking classes with ALX online.</p>



         <h2> Command Lines</h2>
         <p> The first thing I learnt about programming with ALX is learning how to use the Terminal on my laptop with Command Lines </p>


         <h3> Git & Github</h3>
         <p> I enjoyed learning about git anf github particularly about github. I am still getting used to git and understanging it.</p>

         <h3> JavaScript</h3>
         <p> I am still getting used to the basics of JavaScript and i hope by the end of the 2 month I would be better than my first month</p>
